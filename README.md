I am responsible for database administration and customization. Here are a few examples VSI(https://bit.ly/3zGrH9E) and Accela(https://bit.ly/3tKywTD). VSI's data server is Progress, and Accela is SQL Server 2019; fusus(bit.ly/3mWVtzg). They manage the critical parts of the City's infrastructure.

The projects I have down the road. I several old and complex asp and asp apps with good backend and rules engines. They modernize image of our shop if we covert  the UX to Vue or Angular.  I am pushing for Vue because it seems more ture to the roots of JavaScript.
